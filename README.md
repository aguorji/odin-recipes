# My First Recipe Website 🍲

This is a basic recipe website I'm building as part of my HTML practice from The Odin Project. The goal here isn’t to make it look fancy (yet), but to get really comfortable with writing clean, structured HTML.

## What This Project Is About

I’m creating a main homepage (`index.html`) that links to a few individual recipe pages. Each recipe page will have a title, a short description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions — maybe even a mouth-watering photo or two!

It's simple, but it's helping me get the hang of:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Structuring pages properly
- Linking between multiple pages
- Using lists, headings, images, and more

## Why I’m Doing This

This is all about building strong HTML fundamentals. It may not be styled yet (no CSS for now!), but laying this foundation is super important before moving on to the prettier parts later.

## What I’ll Learn

By the time I’m done, I should be comfortable with:
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Organizing content clearly using headings and lists
- Embedding images and using proper HTML tags

## Status

🚧 Currently working on it. One recipe page down — a few more to go!
