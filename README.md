# My First Recipe Website 

This is a basic recipe website I'm building as part of my HTML practice from The Odin Project. The goal here isnâ€™t to make it look fancy (yet), but to get really comfortable with writing clean, structured HTML.

## What This Project Is About

Iâ€™m creating a main homepage (`index.html`) that links to a few individual recipe pages. Each recipe page will have a title, a short description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions â€” maybe even a mouth-watering photo or two!

It's simple, but it's helping me get the hang of:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Structuring pages properly
- Linking between multiple pages
- Using lists, headings, images, and more

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

This is all about building strong HTML fundamentals. It may not be styled yet (no CSS for now!), but laying this foundation is super important before moving on to the prettier parts later.

## What Iâ€™ll Learn

By the time Iâ€™m done, I should be comfortable with:
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Organizing content clearly using headings and lists
- Embedding images and using proper HTML tags

## Status

ðŸš§ Currently working on it. One recipe page down â€” a few more to go!
 

 Project Introduction
This project is a recipe webpage built using semantic HTML. It includes well-structured sections for ingredients and preparation steps for multiple dishes. Each recipe uses appropriate headings, ordered and unordered lists, and follows accessibility best practices.

By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of semantic HTML5 structure, the effective use of nested lists, and proper content organization. This project will help strengthen my foundational web development skills, focusing on clean, readable, and accessible markup.

 Self-Reflection (After Completing the Project)
I created a recipe webpage featuring detailed instructions for dishes like Chicken and Rice Soup and Creamy Tomato Basil Soup. Each recipe includes a brief introduction, an ingredient list, and clearly structured step-by-step instructions.

Through this project, I became more comfortable using semantic HTML elements like <h3>, <ul>, <ol>, and properly nesting content. I also practiced writing meaningful commit messages and learned how to break content into digestible, accessible sections. It was a great exercise in organizing HTML for both users and future developers.
